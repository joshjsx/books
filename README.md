Very Quick and very dirty visual display of a book list. 

## Requirements ##
- Each row should display information about the book: Title, Author, Avg Rating, Genre
- Up to 3 books can be starred, which pins them to the top of the list
- Rows should be reorderable 
- starred books can be reordered amongst themselves, as can unstarred books, but starred books are always at the top
- The covers of the first three books in the list (regardless of starred or unstarred) are featured on top of the bookshelf (see design below)
- At the bottom of the list is a “+ New Book” button that adds another book to the table (can just use mocked data)
